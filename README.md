- Solution URL:(https://ferhammaren.github.io/CHA-OrderSummary/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Rather than learning something, i wanted to keep on working on my design to CSS skills.


### Continued development

I'm not 100% happy with how it looks on larger resolutions, but it's something i want to keep on learning so the design can look beautiful in any resolution without losing too much of the original proportions.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The documentation for TailwindCSS, which i used extensively to remember the syntax.
- [Tailwind playground](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) - To test the layout before commiting it to the actual file.
